# Jailer - P3 Torment Groups

https://wago.io/zCMqsA0HM

Batch players with Torment into groups of 2, assigning each group a raid marker. Spam chat with raid marker.

In Phase 3, torment spawns adds. We saw some of the RWF guilds use a strategy to spawn the adds around the boss. I believe the strategy is that having two players on top of each other is a manageable amount of damage, so they create five groups of 2, and have them stack on each other.

Here's a timestamp to Method's Speed POV where Torment is about to be cast and Speed gets the Torment assignment. They have a graphic that appears in the middle to show where their groups go.

**My WA does not have graphics.**
